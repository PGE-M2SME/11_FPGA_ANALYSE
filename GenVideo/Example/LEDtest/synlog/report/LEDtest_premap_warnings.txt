@W: MT462 :"/home/diamond/SharedFolder/Example/LEDtest/source/clockDivider.v":11:0:11:5|Net clockDivider_inst.clkDivOut appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. If this is a required clock, declare a clock constraint on this net in your constraint file.
@W: MT531 :"/home/diamond/SharedFolder/Example/LEDtest/source/count4.v":9:0:9:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 29 sequential elements including counter3.countbi[3:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/diamond/SharedFolder/Example/LEDtest/source/clockDivider.v":11:0:11:5|Found inferred clock my_pll|CLKOK_inferred_clock which controls 57 sequential elements including clockDivider_inst.clkDivOut. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/diamond/SharedFolder/Example/LEDtest/source/LEDtest.v":13:2:13:3|Found inferred clock topcount|direction which controls 9 sequential elements including my_LEDtest.seg_16. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/diamond/SharedFolder/Example/LEDtest/source/count4.v":9:0:9:5|Found inferred clock topcount|clk which controls 12 sequential elements including counter2.countbi[3:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
